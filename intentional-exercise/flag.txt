Decompiled the code and noticed

URL: "http://34.74.105.127/5aee34db42/appRoot"

"?","SHA-256", "s00p3rs3cr3tk3y"

const-string v2, "%064x"

const/4 v3, 0x1

const-string v1, "&hash="


Had to Google for help. Apprently the AndroidManifest.xml is key for this CTF.

android:host="level13.hacker101.com"


We start the device with a host, 

adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "http://level13.hacker101.com/flagBearer" com.hacker101.level13


Notes:

You can also issue an activity manager command directly from adb without entering a remote shell. For example:
adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW

use the -d option to send commands to the hardware device.
