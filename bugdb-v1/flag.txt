Never queried GraphQL before, was able to use the given IDE to get the fields for the table : user.

{
  user {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        username
        bugs {
          edges {
          	node {
              id
              text
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

Flag was in the text field for bugs in the user victim.
